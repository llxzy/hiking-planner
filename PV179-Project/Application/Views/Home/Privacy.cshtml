    <br><br>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.

</p>


<h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy 
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal 
    requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the

    <br><br>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or

    processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
    

<h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p>
    <i><b>In short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical

    <br><br>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of 
    any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no 
    electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 
    so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be 
    able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will 
    do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is 
    at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

        any time.</i>
    <br><br>

    any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
    <br><br>
    If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent
    at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, 
    nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds 
    other than consent.
    <br><br>
    If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal 
    information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find
    their contact details here:<i> http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. </i>
    <br><br>

    <i>Cookies and similar technologies:</i> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, 
    you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies 
    or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Website. To opt-out of interest-based

    then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you
    service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service 
    requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
</p>   
<ul>
    <li>
        Access your account settings and update your preferences.
    </li>

<h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
    or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals 
    has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that 
    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
    we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
